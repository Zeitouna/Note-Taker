# Note Taker

## Description

This project consisted in building the back-end application of a Note Taker that could write, save and delete notes using an Express.js back-end and to save and retrieve notes data from a JSON file.

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
The application should:
```

- allow the users to create and save notes.
- allow the users to delete saved notes.
- allow the users to view their saved notes.

## Application Use/ Mock-Up
